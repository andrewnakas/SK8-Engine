/**
 * @file        skate3_audio_fixes.cpp
 * @brief       Guest hooks for the rw::audio::core command-queue race
 *
 * The AYN Thor (Snapdragon 8 Gen 2) filled its log with
 *
 *   [cpu] Call to invalid or unregistered function at guest address 0xFFFDFFFF
 *         (guest lr=0x82B3CD64) | r3=00000006 r10=00000000 r11=FFFDFFFF
 *
 * at a steady 187.5 calls a second - which is 48000/256, one per Xbox audio
 * quantum - for twenty-three minutes, and then died writing to guest
 * 0x70000000 on the render thread.
 *
 * Reading the dump register-by-register: `lr` is inside sub_82B3CD38, which
 * builds an audio decoder from a format descriptor:
 *
 *   lwz r11,0(r3)   ; r3 = the FormatDesc
 *   mtctr r11
 *   bctrl           ; desc->GetSize(channels, &size)
 *
 * r3 at the fault is 6 only because the recompiled code has already loaded the
 * NEXT argument into it; the descriptor pointer is r10, and r10 is 0 in every
 * occurrence in every report. The guest reads *(0+0), which is the low guest
 * page holding 0xFFFDFFFF, and calls that.
 *
 * The descriptor is NULL because the lookup that produced it missed. Its
 * callers key the System's format registry by a four-character codec tag taken
 * from a table indexed by a byte on the player object:
 *
 *   sub_82B29018  key = table_8210A310[*(this+352)]   (only 0 and 1 are valid:
 *                                                      'P6L0', 'PFN0')
 *   sub_82B33D40  key = table_82119870[codec id]
 *
 * Every format the game ships, including those two, is registered at startup,
 * so a miss means the INDEX BYTE IS GARBAGE, not that a format is missing.
 *
 * That byte is written by sub_82B28B78 (the SetFormat command handler) out of
 * a 20-byte command record. Records are appended to the System's command
 * queue - buffer *(sys+48), write offset *(sys+204) - and run later on the
 * audio thread by sub_82B48530, which holds the System lock while it does it.
 *
 * sub_82B28A00, the append, takes NO lock. Worse, it publishes the new write
 * offset before it stores the record:
 *
 *   lwz  r9,204(r11)     ; offset
 *   stw  r7,204(r11)     ; PUBLISH offset + 20   <-- first
 *   stw  r6,0(r10)       ; then the handler
 *   stw  r3,4(r10)       ; then the object
 *   stfs f0,8(r10)       ; then the payload
 *
 * A consumer that observes the advanced offset before those stores land runs a
 * record built from whatever the buffer held - typically a stale heap pointer
 * like 0x40C21870, which read as a float and truncated to an integer gives the
 * small values (6, 5, 1) the reports show. The format byte then lands outside
 * {0,1}, the lookup misses forever, and the player retries every audio frame.
 *
 * On the in-order Xenon the window between those stores is a few cycles and
 * the two threads were on the same die. On an out-of-order ARM64 core at
 * 3.2 GHz it is wide enough to hit repeatedly. The recompiler honours the
 * PowerPC barriers (lwsync becomes a seq_cst fence) - there simply are none on
 * this path to honour.
 *
 * sub_82B28A00 is not the only unlocked appender - sub_82B1E458,
 * sub_82B1E4F8, sub_82B1E780 and sub_82B1E8D8 all append the same way with no
 * lock, and any of them racing the drain corrupts the same queue. Only
 * sub_82B1DCD0 among the producers takes the lock. All five are wrapped below.
 * (sub_82B1EBA0 also appends, but it is the one-shot setup path behind an
 * "already initialised" flag, and it reaches its System through neither of the
 * two member paths, so it is left alone.)
 *
 * Nesting is safe: the guest critical section is recursive - see
 * RtlEnterCriticalSection_entry, which increments recursion_count when the
 * owning thread re-enters - and these hooks take the same lock the drain
 * already takes, so no new lock ordering is introduced.
 *
 * The hooks below:
 *   - the five appenders run under the System lock, exactly the lock the drain
 *     takes, which serialises them against it and against each other. The
 *     acquire NEVER blocks: these run on the game's own threads, and parking
 *     one behind an audio worker that Android stopped mid-callback would trade
 *     a glitch for a freeze. If the lock cannot be had, the append proceeds
 *     exactly as it does today.
 *   - sub_82B3CD38 refuses a NULL descriptor instead of calling through it.
 *     Its callers all handle a 0 return (sub_82B29018 stores 255 at +344 and
 *     reports failure), so the guest takes its own error path. If this one
 *     ever fires the log names the format byte, which says whether the race is
 *     really closed.

// This is here because of what a NULL return did on an AYN Thor. In

// address 0x00000000, guest lr=0x82B9568C", with r31 = 0 - which is the
// signature the Thor filled its log with, twice per run, ten seconds after the
// audio format lookup failed the same way. The report could name the fault but
// not the object, because the name never reached the log.
//
// The hook does nothing but read the name back on a miss. It is bounded to the
// first misses of a session: this lookup is generic and a miss is a legitimate

// The size is -12. sub_82F52040 is a normal PowerPC memset: it takes the count

// dump's `r0 = 0x0FFFFFFF` is exactly 0xFFFFFFF4 >> 4 - then stores its way

// reserved but not committed, and dies there. 0x70000000 is not a meaningful
// address; it is simply how far it got.

// coherent state (a buffer of zero length, which its callers already handle -
// sub_82B7F8A8 tests this family of results for negative values before using
// them) and turns a session-ending crash into one logged line naming the
