// Integrity checker for the guest's small-block pool allocator.
//
// The remaining map-load crash is heap corruption, not a null pointer. A
// --protect_zero=true run caught a WRITE to guest 0x00000004 on render_thread
// with lr = 0x82990940 (sub_82990768 +0x1D8). Decoded:
//
//   sub_82990768 (pool alloc)  read the current chunk's free-block list head
//                              [chunk+8] and got 0xFFFFFFFF
//                              -> treated it as a free block, rounded it down
//                                 to its 32 KiB chunk header:
//                                 ((0xFFFFFFFF+0x7FFF) & 0xFFFF8000) - 0x8000
//                                 = 0xFFFF8000
//   sub_8298CEF8 (list unlink) node->next and node->prev at 0xFFFF8000 read as
//                              0, so "next->prev = prev" stored through null.
//
// The null store is three steps downstream of the defect. The defect is that
// 0xFFFFFFFF was in the free list at all - something wrote -1 into a block that
// was sitting free, or into the chunk header itself. By the time the allocator
// trips over it the writer is long gone, so this file catches the corruption at
// the earliest moment it is observable and records enough to name the writer:
//
//   1. Every alloc sweeps all 20 size-class bins and checks each bin's head
//      chunk's free-list head. A legitimate value is 0 or a block inside that
//      chunk; anything else is definitive, no lock needed. This fires one step
//      BEFORE the crash, while the chunk pointer is still in hand.
//   2. Every free poisons the block it is about to release (past word 0, which
//      the allocator uses for the free-list link) and records who freed it.
//      Every alloc verifies the poison of the block it hands back. A block that
//      changed while it was free is a use-after-free, and the recorded free-site
//      lr names the subsystem that owned it.
//
// Off by default: it costs a 40-load sweep plus a block-sized fill per pool op.
//
// Layout below was decoded from generated/skate3_recomp.53.cpp (sub_82990768,
