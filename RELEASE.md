# Release guide

This repository is the top-level source fork. It intentionally keeps the
Skate-specific rexglue runtime as a Git submodule, matching upstream's
architecture. End users still receive one normal application archive; source
builders clone with `--recursive`.

The Custom Engine Layer preview is supported on Windows/D3D12. It builds and
runs on Linux/Vulkan, but sustained gameplay has not been signed off and there
is no Linux packaging script, so Linux builds are developer builds rather than
published releases. macOS is still unvalidated.

Before publishing a source or binary revision:

1. Confirm the companion runtime submodule resolves from the public
   `SK8-ENGINE/SK8-Engine-Runtime` fork.
2. Confirm `generated/`, `game/`, runtime data, retail media, DLC, saves,
   `.skate` packages, Blender scenes, export caches, logs and screenshots are
   untracked.
3. Run the owned-world unit tests and Blender addon workflow test.
4. Build the Windows Release target from a recursive clean clone.
5. Package with the script below and inspect the complete staged file list.
6. Confirm `NOTICE.md`, `LICENSE-PROJECT.md`, `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, and checksums
   are present in the archive.
7. Upload the archive, then copy the generated `out/packages/update-manifest.toml`
   to `release/update-manifest.toml` on the public default branch. Do not
   advertise an asset until its uploaded size and SHA-256 match the manifest.

## Windows binary package

After building the Release target, run:

```powershell
.\scripts\Package-Windows-Release.ps1 `
  -Version 0.1.0 `
  -BuildDirectory .\out\build\release
```

The packager rebuilds `owned_world_material_addon.zip` from its reviewed
source files before staging it, so the release always contains the same
self-contained GUI/exporter code as the repository.

It also emits `update-manifest.toml` beside the archive. The in-game updater
reads the reviewed copy under `release/` from the public default branch,
downloads only GitHub-hosted assets, verifies the exact size and SHA-256, and
then overlays release-owned files. It preserves `game`, `saves`,
`settings.toml`, `active_map.txt`, and user-added map files.

For the canonical research workspace's existing build directory:

```powershell
.\scripts\Package-Windows-Release.ps1 `
  -Version dev `
  -BuildDirectory ..\build\skate3-custom-engine-layer-release
```

The default Windows archive is named
`Skate3CustomEngineLayer-<version>-Windows.zip`. The executable remains
`skate3.exe` for runtime and save-data compatibility.

The packager creates a zip containing only:

- `skate3.exe`;
- `rexruntime.dll`;
- map/player documentation;
- the first-party Blender Feature Park `.skate` map and its self-contained
  editable `.blend` source;
- project licensing, notices, changelog, and known issues;
- the Blender addon and format documentation;
- a release-facing `maps` folder for additional packages; and
- SHA-256 checksums.

It fails closed if the stage contains known retail, generated-code, map,
Blender-scene, cache, log, save, or diagnostic file types.

## Source validation

Clone into a new directory rather than relying on an existing submodule
checkout:

```powershell
git clone --recursive `
  https://github.com/SK8-ENGINE/SK8-Engine.git
```

The build still requires the developer's own extracted Skate 3 game data.
Never copy that data into the source tree used for publication.

## Runtime validation

Validate both a small map and a very large map through **Settings > Maps**.
Confirm the new process log names the selected package and that only one
`skate3` process remains after the five-second shutdown watchdog. Visual and
playability testing remains manual; release automation does not move the
skater or capture screenshots.
